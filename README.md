dots-and-lines AI
----

This project was part of a university course on AI -- a place where comments were used for source code management, and code reviews weren't a thing.

The assignment spec has been long lost, but the following contains a [Reinforcement Learning (RL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) algorithm trained to solve the [Dots and Boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_and_Boxes) game.  It is believed to be the variant, [Temporal difference learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporal_difference_learning).

It has been left in the original state.


Usage
